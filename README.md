# bigButtonTimer
 
A really simple bit of code programmed in C/Arduino that runs on an arduino nano which drives an 8 segment display and UI is a big arcade style button. It has 3 modes (long press to switch modes) 
- stopwatch (first short button press pauses, second resets)
- pomodoro  - does a work/break/work/break/work/long-break/work : 25/5/25/5/25/30/5mins timer cycle (short press pauses)
- counter - each short press adds one to the count

TODO
